## Problem 1 - List comprehensions

Which right triangle that has integers for all sides and all sides equal
to or smaller than 10 has a perimeter of 24?

## Problem 2 - Infinite primes

Create a stream that generates all the prime numbers, so you can take the 1st
n primes form it using `Enum.take/2`

## Problem 3 - Polymorphism

Create an implementation of `Enumerable` for binary strings, such that
you can manipulate each character in a string with Enum.each/2.
